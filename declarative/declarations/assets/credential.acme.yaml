  - key: Size
    type: <integer>
    presence: optional
    content: The size of the data at the 'DataURL'. Use this value to verify that
      the returned data is the expected data. Use this value to detect when the data
      changes.
  - key: Hash-SHA-256
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
    content: |-
      A SHA-256 hash of the data at the 'DataURL'. Use this value to verify that the returned data is the expected data. Use this value to detect when the data changes.
