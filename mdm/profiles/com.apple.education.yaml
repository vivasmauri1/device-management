  content: This payload is used to configure Classroom students, Classroom instructors,
    and the Shared iPad login screen. These do not necessarily require the same set
    of keys to be present in their payloads, so make sure to include all keys that
    are required for the education product you are configuring.

  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The organization's UUID identifier. This identifier can be any valid UUID.
    All teacher and student devices that need to communicate with one another must
    have the same organization UUID, particularly if they originated from different
    Device Enrollment Programs.
- key: OrganizationName
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The organization's display name. The system displays this name in the iOS
    login screen.
- key: PayloadCertificateUUID

- key: LeaderPayloadCertificateAnchorUUID
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    The array of UUIDs referring to certificate payloads within the same profile that the system uses to authorize leader peer certificate identities. This array needs to contain all necessary certificates to validate the entire chain of trust. Leader certificates needs to have the common name prefix leader, which is case insensitive.
    This property doesn't support identity payloads or PKCS12 certificates.
    Required when configuring a student device for Classroom, and ignored when configuring an instructor device. Has no effect on the configuration of the Shared iPad login screen.
